# plasmodata
This is a Plasmodium proteome annotator which reads a list of geneIDs as input and outputs data about the protein's description, chromosome, locus, accession numbers, orthologs, molecular weight, protein length, transmembrane domains, signalp score, mutagenesis index score, GO terms, gene sequence (with and without introns), and protein sequence. 
All information is pulled from the PlasmoDB knowledge base.
